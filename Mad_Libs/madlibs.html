                I was walking down ${streetName} the other day, and a student ${verb1}ing a ${noun1} approached me and asked me, "${question}" I was ${emotion}. I couldn't believe a ${adjective1} person, who was also ${verb2}ing a ${noun2} at the time. I said I ${doOrDoNot} and started walking away since I was late for a ${event} called "${adjective2} ${noun3}." They started following me and started to ${verb3}. I found out they were the ${employeeType} for the event! They snuck me into ${place}, and we have been ${relationshipType} ever since!
